# Use the active voice

To use the active voice means that the subject of the sentence takes the action. In passive voice, the action is done to the subject. For example:

- <strong>Active voice</strong> - The line lead entered production via the job page.
- <strong>Passive voice</strong> - Production was entered on the job page by the
  line lead.

This subject-verb-object sentence structure of active voice is not used in all languages, but it is widely recognized and is therefore more likely to be translated properly.
