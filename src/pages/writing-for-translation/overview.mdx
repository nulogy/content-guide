# Writing for translation

Nulogy works with customers all over the world, which means that our text is often translated into many different languages. Therefore, it is important that we take translation into account when we write.

Translations for the copy we write for our software is partially automated. Translations are generated removed from context or rules like length parameters. This means that we must do everything we can to ensure that our text is primed to translate smoothly.
