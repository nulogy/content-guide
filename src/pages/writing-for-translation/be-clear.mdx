# Be clear

While we want to keep our language concise, certain words that in English appear as if they can be cut will help with clarity if they are included.

Repeated verbs and subjects can help when it comes to translations. For example:

<YesExample>
  Users have the option <strong>to pick materials</strong> in our mobile
  interface or to pick materials in our desktop interface.
</YesExample>
<YesExample mb="x4">
  Bills of materials <strong>can be</strong> drafted manually in the Operational
  Solution or <strong>can be</strong> uploaded via csv.
</YesExample>

In addition to the inclusion of repeated subject and verbs, it is also best practice to leave in words like “then”, “a”, “that”, “the”, and “to” even if they seem like they can be cut. For example:

<YesExample>
  Our products help our users <strong>to</strong> achieve efficiency,
  innovation, and sustainability.
</YesExample>
<YesExample mb="x4">
  If you have not entered labor on your job, <strong>then</strong> you may not
  be able to enter production.
</YesExample>

Avoid words with multiple meanings. Some English words can mean many different things, which can result in confusing or wrong translations. Choose words that are specific and unambiguous. For example:

<NoExample>
  You have <strong>reached</strong> the maximum expansion.
</NoExample>
<YesExample mb="x4">
  You have expanded as many items as can be displayed.
</YesExample>

In context, the verb “reach” makes sense. But reach is also a physical verb that can refer to the action of extending your arm to grab for something. The new sentence is slightly longer, but it is more clear.

Finally, avoid words ending in “-ing”. Many different classifications of words in the English language add the “-ing” suffix. This includes nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. Because of this, these types of words will often be translated in the same way even if the context requires different handling. Take care to edit your sentences to avoid the use of “-ing” words wherever possible. For example:

<NoExample>This report has completed processing.</NoExample>
<YesExample>This report has been processed.</YesExample>
