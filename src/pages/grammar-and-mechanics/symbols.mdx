# Symbols

## Hyphens

Use a hyphen "-" to indiciate a range. The exception is dates, which spells out "to".

<NoExample>

</NoExample>
<YesExample>
  Search pallets produced from April 1, 2021 to April 30, 2021
</YesExample>

## Percentages

Always use the "%" symbol.

<NoExample>80 percent of pallets produced.</NoExample>
<YesExample>80% of pallets produced.</YesExample>

## Currrency

Specific currencies use the three digit currency code directly after the amount. Our customers do a lot of international business and this is the most clear way to discern currency as some currencies (like Canada and the United States) use the same symbol.

<NoExample>The price per unit for Item 12345 is $50</NoExample>
<YesExample>The price per unit for Item 12345 is 50 USD</YesExample>

## Ampersands

Wherever possible, write out “and”. Only use “&” if you refer to a formal name that includes the symbol (such as the name of a company), or if you are really tight on space.
