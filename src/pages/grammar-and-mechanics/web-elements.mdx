## Buttons and links

Both buttons and links should be written in sentence case.

<Flex justifyContent="space-between" maxWidth={COPY_WIDTH} m="0 auto" mb="x4">
  <NoExample>
    <PrimaryButton>Manage Picking</PrimaryButton>
  </NoExample>
  <YesExample>
    <PrimaryButton>Manage picking</PrimaryButton>
  </YesExample>
</Flex>

Button text begins with an imperative verb that describes the action that will be taken (e.g. Assign pallets). Where possible, the verb should be followed by a descriptive noun.

<Flex justifyContent="space-between" maxWidth={COPY_WIDTH} m="0 auto" mb="x4">
  <NoExample>
    <PrimaryButton>More actions</PrimaryButton>
  </NoExample>
  <YesExample>
    <PrimaryButton>View more actions</PrimaryButton>
  </YesExample>
</Flex>

Links inform the user of where they will be directed to when they click. Always use descriptive links. Never refer to a link in body copy then provide a link labelled “link”.

A good rule is to make the link text the heading of the page to which it navigates.

<NoExample>
  <a href="#">Click here</a> to view the move transaction report for this job.
</NoExample>
<YesExample>
  View the <a href="#">move transaction report</a> for this job.
</YesExample>

## Site settings

Nulogy’s Operational Solution has many site settings that allow both our customer and internal Nulogy users to customize the experience for a given site. In order to help site setting users to easily navigate and understand the various customizable settings, we employ certain rules when writing a new site setting.

If the setting is a checkbox (as is most common), start the label with a verb. This will help the user to know what happens when the setting is enabled.

<NoExample>
  <Checkbox
    labelText="Default print pallet tags when adding production"
    className="inline"
  />
</NoExample>

<YesExample>
  <Checkbox
    labelText="Default print pallet tags when adding production"
    className="inline"
  />
</YesExample>

Common verbs for site settings are allow, enable, restrict, and require. A setting that takes any of these actions should always use these verbs. No synonyms.

- <strong>Allow</strong> refers to a setting that permits an action that is usually
  restricted.
- <strong>Enable</strong> refers to a setting that adds a new function to the interface.
- <strong>Restrict</strong> refers to a setting that blocks an action that is usually
  allowed.
- <strong>Require</strong> refers to a setting that creates a mandate.

If the setting is a form field or a dropdown, verbs are not required. These instances should be treated like a regular label and should describe the form field effectively.

Site setting labels should be kept as succinct as possible. Especially when the repercussions of a site setting is complex, it can be easy to want to write in detail. Any setting that needs elaboration should employ tooltips. In general, a site setting label should not exceed 50 characters at absolute maximum. If possible, try to cap the label at 3-4 words.

<NoExample>
  <Checkbox
    labelText="Require specifying lot and expiries for rejects that Track-by-Job"
    className="inline"
  />
</NoExample>

<YesExample>
  <Checkbox
    labelText="Require lots and expiries for track by job rejects"
    className="inline"
  />
</YesExample>

Tooltips can be longer to allow for expansion on complex concepts. Site setting tooltips should always be present tense and be complete sentences.

## Tooltips

Tooltip text should always be kept short and to the point. If your message cannot be said in one or two sentences, then alternate informational methods should be considered.

Tooltips may be used to expand on text that has been truncated, or to provide quick instruction or elaboration. If it contains a full sentence, it should include proper punctuation. If it is a sentence fragment or expansion, no punctuation should be used.
