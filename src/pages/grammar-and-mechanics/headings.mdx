# Headings and subheadings

Headings should always be used to describe any text or interactions that can be achieved in the body below. They should be short and descriptive.

Subheadings are not always necessary. They are most useful when the concept introduced in the heading can be broken down further into more specific or descriptive parts. For example, if I need to break up text on the job page in the Operational Solution, I might include the subheadings “manual entry”, “time records” and “breaks” under the heading “time tracking”.

Headings and subheadings are sentence case and do not include punctuation. You may add a question mark if the heading poses a question that is answered in the body copy. This may be most common in help desk articles.
