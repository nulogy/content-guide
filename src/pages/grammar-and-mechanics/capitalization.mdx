# Capitalization

In general, we always use sentence case. Sentence case is when the first letter of the first word of the phrase is capitalized, and each word after is lowercase.

For a comprehensive list of rules and examples, please refer to the <Link href={CapitalizationCheatSheet}>capitalization cheat sheet</Link>.

On a high level, these are some general rules:

## Headings

Headings and subheadings use sentence case.

<NoExample>Edit Production Records</NoExample>
<YesExample>Edit production records</YesExample>

## Product names

Use title case for the names of our products.

<NoExample>
  The ecosystem solution allows brands insights into the production process.
</NoExample>
<YesExample>
  The Ecosystem Solution allows brands insights into the production process.
</YesExample>

## Team names

Use title case for the names of our or customers' teams.

<NoExample>
  Someone from professional services will contact you.
</NoExample>
<YesExample>
  Professional Services team will contact you.
</YesExample>
<YesExample>
  Someone from Professional Services will contact you.
</YesExample>

## Tools

Tools should be lowercase unless they are beginning a sentence or header.

<NoExample>Find pallets thorugh Item Locator</NoExample>
<YesExample>Find pallets through item locator.</YesExample>

## Nulogy objects

Only capitalize unique instances of Nulogy objects that refer to a specific example.

<NoExample>The pick list associated with ship order 12345...</NoExample>
<YesExample mb="x4">The pick list associated with Ship Order 12345...</YesExample>

General references to a Nulogy object should be lowercase.

<NoExample>Create a Ship Order</NoExample>
<YesExample>Create a ship order</YesExample>

## Reference to UI elements

Use the same capitalization as in the UI when referring to UI elements in your documentation, in-app content, or customer communications.

Add visual emphasis (<strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic</em>, or "_") for enhanced understanding.

<NoExample>Click Save Now Button</NoExample>
<YesExample mb="x4">Click <strong>Save now</strong> button</YesExample>
