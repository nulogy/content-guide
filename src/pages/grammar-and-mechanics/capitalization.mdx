# Capitalization

In general, we always use sentence case. Sentence case is when the first letter of the first word of the phrase is capitalized and each word after is lowercase.

Some general rules:

## Headings

Headings and subheadings use sentence case.


<NoExample>Edit Production Records</NoExample>
<YesExample>Edit production records</YesExample>

## Product names

Use title case for the names of our products

<NoExample>The ecosystem solution allows brands insights into the production process.</NoExample>
<YesExample>The Ecosystem Solution allows brands insights into the production process.</YesExample>

## Tools and functions

Tools and functions should be lowercase, unless they are beginning a sentence or header.

<NoExample>Find pallets thorugh Item Locator</NoExample>
<YesExample>Find pallets through item locator.</YesExample>

## Nulogy entities

Only capitalize an entity within Nulogy that refers to a specific example.

<NoExample>This pick list is for ship order 12345.</NoExample>
<YesExample mb="x4">This pick list is for Ship Order 12345</YesExample>

General references to a Nulogy entity should be lowercase.

<NoExample>Create a Ship Order</NoExample>
<YesExample>Create a ship order</YesExample>
